# Development Workflow

## Command Execution Rules

**NEVER use chained commands with `&&` for development tasks.** Always execute commands step by step for better error handling and debugging.

### ❌ FORBIDDEN Command Patterns

```bash
cd next-app && npm run dev
cd next-app && npm install package-name
cd next-app && npm run build && npm start
```

### ✅ REQUIRED Command Patterns

**Step 1: Navigate to the next-app directory**
```bash
cd next-app
```

**Step 2: Execute the specific command**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Or for other operations:**
```bash
npm install package-name
npm run build
npm run lint
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Development Server

To start the development server:

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd next-app
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Package Management

To install new packages:

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd next-app
   ```

2. **Install packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install package-name
   # or for shadcn/ui components
   npx shadcn@latest add component-name
   ```

## Database Operations

For Drizzle operations:

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd next-app
   ```

2. **Run database commands:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate    # Generate migrations
   npm run db:push        # Push to database
   npm run db:studio      # Open Drizzle Studio
   ```

## Build and Production

For production builds:

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd next-app
   ```

2. **Build application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start production server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Benefits of Step-by-Step Execution

- **Better error isolation:** If navigation fails, you know immediately
- **Clearer debugging:** Each step can be verified independently  
- **Environment persistence:** Stay in the correct directory for multiple commands
- **Command history:** Each command is logged separately for easier troubleshooting
